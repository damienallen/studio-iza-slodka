                                    Makers’ Maze is a winning entry for
                                    Europan 15 competition for Vierhavensblok
                                    in Rotterdam. The choice of
                                    this site was motivated by my ongoing
                                    fascination with postindustrial sites
                                    and informal urban spaces. My prior
                                    research and observations could be
                                    implemented in this new Rotterdam
                                    harbour context.

                                    conditions for creativity, circularity,
                                    interaction, sharing and freedom while

                                    The charm of the Vierhavensblok is
                                    its informal character where one finds
                                    the unexpected around each corner
                                    and where chance encounters breed
                                    new collaborations. Inspired by these
                                    qualities I propose a series of interlocking
                                    building clusters organized around
                                    a network of passages, streets and
                                    squares, creating a unified, resilient,
                                    and intriguing urban scheme. The goal
                                    is to build on the present sense of
                                    community and self-initiative by leaving
                                    enough room for organic growth and
                                    adaptation.
